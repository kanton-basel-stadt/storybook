# About the BS.ch design system

Welcome to the Design System documentation of BS.ch. This page aims

## Purpose and goals

The purpose of the DDS ("Digital Design System") is to provide a unified and low-threshold way to build websites in the look & feel of www.bs.ch.

The system itself consists of three pillars:
 * The Figma files: These contain the overall design specifications, reasoning and the nitty gritty details.
 * The Unplugin: The software used to install all the CSS necessary to create the look & feel.
 * The Storybook: The thing you're currently looking at.

The individual pillars are discussed in their respective chapters found in the navigation.

## Usage

To create a website using the DDS, follow these steps:

 1. Create your application with a framework of choice. The only hard dependency is a frontend build tool, such as Vite, Webpack, ESBuild or similar.
 2. Install the DDS Unplugin as a dependency and configure it according to its documentation.
 3. Start building your application backend and frontend.
 4. Build frontend components with markup found in Storybook

It is important that you keep the DDS Unplugin up to date. The maintainers will inform you of any major update.
