# About Storybook

Storybook provides a set of default components, such as form inputs, form elements (stepper navigation, fieldsets, etc.), the page header and footer, tables, typography and much more.

The structure follows the structure of the CSS files provided in the Unplugin.

## Usage

To create a component, you can install the DDS unplugin, configure it according to your framework and start using the markup provided in Storybook.

To do so, select the components you want from the left and open them by clicking. They should open the component detail page. You can look at the HTML code necessary to create this component by opening the "HTML" tab beneath the component preview. You can copy this code and use it in your framework of choice. You may alter the code to your liking and adapt it to your needs.

**Make sure to check the markup you copied for icons (usually starting with `<icon-`) and import them according to the Unplugin documentation.**

## Configuring a component

Some components offer some form of configuration. All options can be found in the tab "Controls" on the component detail page. If you configure a component, the markup in the "HTML" tab also changes. In summary, you can configure your component in a WYSIWYG style and copy the finished markup, which is ready to use.

## The structure

The structure of the components is as follows:

 * **Buttons** (Contains all sorts of buttons, such as standard buttons, "super" variants, etc.)
 * **Form elements** (For all things forms.)
   * **Building blocks** (To build everything a form needs which is not form inputs, such as stepper navigation, field sets, etc.)
   * **Inputs** (all form inputs and their variants.)
 * **Icons** (A list of all icons.)
 * **Page frame** (Contains everything to build pages without much content, such as header, footer, container, etc.)
 * **Sections** (Special sections used to build content.)
 * **Typography** (Titles, leads, paragraphs, etc.)
 * **Tailwind** (For all things Tailwind.)
   * Contrast checker (To check if any two colours provide enough contrast to be used as background and foreground together, with alternatives.)
   * Config viewer (To view the entire Tailwind config.)
